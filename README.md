## About
_The Pelster Net_ will be a central website for the Pelster family and those related to them. The site aims to keep family members up-to-date on life events, changes in contact information, and a place to share beloved hobbies. 


### Structure
The website will consist of three (3) main components, the event log (as the main homepage), the contact tree (contact lists), and the hobby roots (a place to share details on hobbies, activities, and recipes).

#### Event Log
This is where family members can share life events, upcoming gatherings, or general updates. Posts are continuously added to the log in chronological order.

#### Contact Tree
This is where family and friend relations are recorded and where contact information for those on the site can be accessed. The aim of this easily accessible contact information is that family and friends can more easily stay in touch.

#### Hobby Roots
The initial focus of this is to allow easy sharing of food recipes that are favorites of the family. But the space could expand to include crafts, such as quilting and sewing activities, as well as prime activity locations, such as great hikes or cool restaurants.


### Family Members (Users)
The user base is expected to expand beyond the immediate Pelster family, especially as the family grows and includes close family friends. A [Trust](#trust) account creation process will be implemented to ensure that new users receive support from current users on the site.

#### Trust
Account creation requires that new users be sponsored by current users of the site before they can be added.


### Website
The URL of _The Pelster Net_ website will be [thepelster.net](https://www.thepelster.net).



## Development

### Framework
The framework of choice will be the *Django* framework which primarily uses *Python*. This is primarily to give more people the possiblity of contributing new features and because it is what I am most familiar with.
